I have wanted to create a blog for some time. I am also hoping to be able to move https://edwin.genego.io to a blog of
its own. Reason being two-fold; I'm slowly but surely becoming more interested in writing about what I do in software,
and before AI takes over the world, I really want to document my last days on earth (just-kidding).

my intention is to blog on the weekends, while I am trying to fit in some of my side projects for fun and to stay on the
top of my game. At the moment I am mostly interested in Django, Python, AI and LLMs. But as this blog takes form, I am
sure I will touch some other things as well.

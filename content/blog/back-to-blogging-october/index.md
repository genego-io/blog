Perhaps it is premature to say that I am back, however, spending some time in reflections over the past few weeks, it
feels like what I am missing is this blog as an outlet. So regardless whether I want; I will start making some time for
writing about what I enjoy doing; which is Django and Python. So expect more from here, on a weekly schedule. Promised.

description: "Writing takes more time than I do have!"
---

A couple of months ago, I set an ambitious goal for myself: to post content regularly, aiming for at least once a week.
While the intention was genuine, the reality of juggling tasks set in, leading to a two-month hiatus. One of the
challenges I've faced is allocating time to write about my projects without detracting from the actual time I spend on
them. It's a balancing act that I've grappled with over the years, leading me to start, pause, and even delete my blog
multiple times. However, I remain optimistic as this platform remains intact and serves as a testament to my commitment.

During these two months, I dedicated my free weekends diving into the potential of LLMs, and it's been quite the
revelation! My journey also took me deeper into React, allowing me to discern the complexities and challenges that
contemporary web development presents. As part of my ongoing experiments, I've been developing a side-project todo app—a
concept that may seem commonplace but offers immense learning. Parallelly, I'm exploring the capabilities of HTMX and
Alpine JS. Both tools hint at the future direction of web development, though there's still ground to cover.

I appreciate your patience and look forward to sharing more updates soon—hopefully, in a shorter timeframe than the
last!

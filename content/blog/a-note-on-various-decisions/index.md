Working on the redesign, I find myself wondering whether the approach I am taking is the right one. So I am allowing
myself some time to elaborate and reflect on the choices I am making and the goal I am hoping to reach.

### The framework (Wagtail -> Django, Python, Jinja, HTMX, CSS)

#### The options

There are many options to choose from when building a website & blog. At its lightest, all I would need to do is find a
static site host, and write everything I want to be online as markdown formatted text. Which of course, would be enough
to get my ideas and thoughts out there into the ether. A route, which I see many others take. However, I don't find that
to be enough. An alternative which is still lightweight in its setup would be what I am running now, Gatsby; or Hugo,
Jekyll, Astro, etc.

#### The choice

All great choices, but let's take a step back... I'm a Django developer, continuously diving deeper into Python and
Django. Setting up this website to display a lot of the skills I have attained through Django & Python work. Why would I
choose anything but Python and Django? Perhaps for ease of use, since I can have any of the above options running and
online within less than an hour. But if I did want to have another feature, integrate some functionality, I could do
this with Django a lot easier, while it would probably take me more than twice the amount of time in another framework
or Language. Also, Wagtail is pretty cool as a CMS. As much I like Markdown, it's really great to be able to update all
the content on my website with a rich text editor.

### The Goal: building a personal brand as a developer

The goal for this website/garden is not just to be seen. I feel like I have already achieved that. But what I feel that
I lack for the longevity of my career over the next decades (plural), is a brand. Who-am-I, what-do-I-do. It's not there
yet. And the longer I think about it, the more I realize that I am on an inevitable path of not just being a software
developer, but also making sure that I am "that" software developer (whatever that may mean). And this all starts with
very cool personal website. Maybe later, I extend myself into social media (Mastodon over X) and creating more quality
content in different mediums (video, audio).
